I will create a code quiz application using HTML, CSS , JAVASCRIPT.

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly, Score will subtract from Score (-10)
THEN time is subtracted from the clock (-20 seconds)
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```


## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
